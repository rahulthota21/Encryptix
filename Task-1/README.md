# Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

## Part 1: Overview

This task involves building a machine learning model to classify movies into different genres based on their plot summaries or other textual data.

## Objectives

- **Create a Machine Learning model** that predicts movie genres.
- **Experiment with different techniques** such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Genre Classification Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)
- **Description:** The dataset contains movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:** If not already done, clone the main repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulthota21/Encryptix.git


### Part 2: Set Up Your Environment
